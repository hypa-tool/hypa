Models a counter tha increases (or decreases) by a non-deterministically chosen step size.

a = 0
x = \star 
repeat 
    a = a + x

We very that for all executions, there exists some with the negated value (when observed at the repeat location), i.e.,
\forall \pi_1. \exists \pi_2. a_(\pi_2) = - a_(\pi_1)

Name of the benchmark in the paper: CounterDiff
