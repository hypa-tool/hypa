Verification of a simple refinement property.
The program is 

if \star then {
    x = 0
    c = 0
    while true do {
        x = x + 1
    }
} else {
    x = 0
    c = 1
    while true do {
        x = x + \star
    }
}

We show that every execution in the first branch (where c is set to 0) refines on of the second branch (where c is set to 1).

Name of the benchmark in the paper: Refine
