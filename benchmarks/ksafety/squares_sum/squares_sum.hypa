Example program, adapted from [Property Directed Self Composition, Ron Shemer, Arie Gurfinkel, Sharon Shoham, Yakir Vizel, CAV 2019].
In pseudo code with pre and post conditions this programs is the following:

pre(a1 < a2 && b2 < b1 )

squaresSum(int a, int b){
    assume(0 < a < b);
    int c=0;
    while (a<b) {
        c+=1; a++;
    }
    return c;
}

post(c2 < c1)


Name of the benchmark in the paper: SquaresSum
