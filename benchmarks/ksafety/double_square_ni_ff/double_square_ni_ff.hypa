Example program, taken from [Constraint-based Relational Verification, Hiroshi Unno, Tachio Terauchi, Eric Koskinen, CAV 2021].
Similar to double_square_ni but the value of h is already fixed.

See https://github.com/hiroshi-unno/coar/blob/main/benchmarks/cav2021rel/DoubleSquareNI_hFF.clp

Name of the benchmark in the paper: DoubleSquareNIff
